NFT Metaverse - BuildQuest hackathon 2022
===

NFT Metaverse is a immersive virtual world where user can meet, socialize and play games. 
NFTs play an important role for personalizing the user experience and as a foundation of games / virtual economies inside the metaverse.
The NFT metaverse combines existing NFT art owned by the user and combines it with a generative algorithm to produce a virtual world where the user can move around.
